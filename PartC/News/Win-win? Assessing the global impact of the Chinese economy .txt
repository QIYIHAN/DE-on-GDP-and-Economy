Win-win? Assessing the global impact of the Chinese economy
a b s t r a c t We study the global impact of the Chinese economy based on a novel indirect approach where the spillover effect is quantified from a forecast error model under relatively favorable identifying conditions. Findings from the real- time World Economic Outlook data over the period 2004  2015 indicate that an increase in economic growth in China had a negative impact on most other economies one to two years ahead. The estimations furthermore uncover evidence at the global level that spillover propagated by influencing prices, including global commodity prices, which tend to increase in reaction to accelerating economic growth in China. 1. Introduction The global financial crisis brought into focus the importance of spillovers for macroeconomic policy, including monetary policy. Re- cently, the impact of the ongoing economic slowing in China, the world’s largest goods exporter, has emerged as a significant concern. 1 Previous evidence about the issue is sharply divided. Some studies find that a slowdown in economic growth in China tends to negatively influence other countries ( Dizioli et al., 2017 ; Feldkircher and Korhonen, 2014 ; Arora and Vamvakidis, 2011 ), while other studies report contrary find- ings ( Autor et al., 2016 ; Bloom et al., 2016 ; Pierce and Schott, 2016 ). Using a novel econometric approach with transparent identifying conditions, the present study provides estimates of the global impact of the Chinese economy. Focusing on the short to mid-term (one-year- ahead) perspective, the study covers over 170 countries during 20042015. The analysis yields the robust finding that the macroeconomic impact of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth tends to be positive in other countries. A one percentage point (pp) slowdown in Chinese economic growth anticipates an increase in GDP growth in the median country globally by an estimated 0.1 pp. In line with earlier empirical works such as Furceri et al. (2016) and ( Dedola et al., 2017 ), the analysis reveals significant variation of spillovers across global regions and countries. Emerging Asia and Latin America are negatively influenced by an economic slowdown in China, while positive effects are found in other parts of the world. The global and the regional findings mask significant variation across countries ( Table A1 ). For example, Brazil and Argentina lose from a de- cline in economic growth in China, while France, Germany, Italy and the UK, as well India and Japan benefit. In many countries, spillovers from China are substantial in economic terms. For example, a decrease in Chinese economic growth by 1 pp contributes in Germany to an in- crease in GDP by about 0.6 pp, or EUR 20 bn (based on recent GDP data). These numbers correspond with about EUR 230 for every Ger- man. In contrast, Brazil loses by about 0.7 pp of GDP or USD 12 bn, which translates to USD 60 (BRL 360) for every Brazilian. Spillovers from China are insignificant in about half of the countries, including the US and Australia. The study furthermore sheds light on the spillover channels. Per- haps surprisingly, the estimations indicate that spillovers from China predominantly propagate via prices rather than trade. Adding to previ- ous evidence on the issue ( Zhuo, 2018 ), the study shows that a decrease in Chinese economic growth by 1 pp contributes to a fall in global com- modity prices by about 4%. A corresponding downwards reaction is also found in consumer prices globally. These findings build on a novel empirical strategy, where spillover is quantified indirectly with a forecast error model while using GDP ✩ The views expressed in this document are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the European Commission nor of the Bank of Finland. ∗ Corresponding author.

The novel approach integrates the two fields of study that use forecast errors as the endogenous variable ( Roth, 2019 ; Kothari and Warner, 2006 ; Fama et al., 1969 ) and data revisions as the shock variable ( Suárez Serratoand Wingender,2016 ) ; Chodorow-Reich et al., 2019 ) for causal inference. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that economic growth can have negative externalities globally even if one abstracts from the issue of pollution. It also underscores the importance of international spillovers for monetary policy. Below we formalize the empirical approach, including the finite sam- ple properties of the spillover estimator. A presentation of the data and the estimation results follows. Discussion of the results and future re- search directions concludes. 2. The empirical approach 2.1. The estimable equation Consider the model 𝑌 𝑡 +1 = 𝛼1 + 𝛼2 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 + 𝛼3 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 + ∈𝑡 +1 , (1) where 𝑌 indicates the real GDP growth rate of a country of interest; 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎 indicates the real GDP growth rate of China; 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 capture(s) all other systematic factors that cause 𝑌 ; ∈is white noise; and 𝛼are unknown parameters. The focus of interest is the parameter 𝛼2 , which indicates the causal influence of 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎 on 𝑌 , the (real GDP growth) spillover from China. In principle, estimation of 𝛼2 is a straightforward linear regression. However, construction of 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 is a difficult challenge as it encompasses a potentially large number of controls, some of which may be unknown. For the purpose of estimating 𝛼2 for over 170 countries, the construction task is impracticable. It is well known that regression analysis using (1) could lead to poor results as the un-modeled correlation between 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎 and 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 may bias the estimate ̂ 𝛼2 . The omitted variable bias is ( Clarke, 2005 ): ̂ 𝛼2 − 𝛼2 = 𝛼3 ∗ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 , 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 ) √ 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 ) 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎 ) , (2) where 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 indicates correlation and 𝑣𝑎𝑟 variance. Since 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎 and 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 are contemporaneous, and thereby affected by common economic events, they are likely to be correlated. Since 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 is not observed, the size or direction of the omitted variable bias is unknown. While lacking the knowledge to credibly estimate 𝛼2 via (1) , we note that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seems much better posi- tioned informationally. The IMF actively monitors the countries of in- terest and has access to a wide range of public and private information about them. Furthermore, since its country analysis has evolved under independent auditing and public scrutiny for decades, substantial insti- tutional knowledge is likely embedded in its processes. The IMF pub- lishes regularly GDP forecasts of its member countries. Might it there- fore be possible to somehow extract the information needed to estimate 𝛼2 from the IMF’s GDP forecasts? We investigate this question under the assumption of linearity. Like the spillover process (1) , the IMF forecast process can also be approxi- mated by a linear function: 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 = 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 1 + 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 2 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 + 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 , (3) where 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 indicates a forecast based on information possessed by the IMF at 𝑡 ; 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 and 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 are real-time data of 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎 and 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟 available to the IMF at 𝑡 ; and 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 are the (unknown) parameters em- bedded in the IMF forecast process which may or may not correspond with the correct parameters. We omit independent random noise from the right-hand side of (3) for simplicity. Please note one subtle point: since (3) is an approximation of the forecasting process of the IMF in- volving both judgement and models (rather than a statement about a specific econometric model), it may not be transparent even within the IMF. By subtracting (3) from (1) and rearranging, we get the error of IMF forecasts: 𝑌 𝑡 +1 − 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 = 𝛼1 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 1 + 𝛼2 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + (𝛼2 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 2 )𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 + 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + ∈𝑡 +1 (4) The forecast error Eq. (4) shows that, indeed, access to IMF fore- casts and real-time data affords the possibility to approach the estima- tion of 𝛼2 from an alternative point of view. Rather than studying the influence of the Chinese economy on other countries directly via (1) , one can approach the problem indirectly by studying IMF forecast er- rors. Part of that error is caused by data revisions regarding 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎. The spillover parameter 𝛼2 can alternatively be interpreted as the strength of this channel. However, Eq. (4) still includes the unobserved variable(s), namely ‘IMF modeling error’ regarding other factors except spillover ( 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ). Does this mean that the indirect forecast error approach (4) is equally affected by missing variable bias as the traditional ap- proach (1) ? If the unobserved IMF modeling error is omitted in empirical estima- tions, the estimate ̂ 𝛼2 may, indeed, be biased. Based on Clarke (2005) , the bias is: ̂ 𝛼2 − 𝛼2 = 𝛼3 ∗ √ √ √ √ √ 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) 𝑣𝑎𝑟 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) ∗ ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ,𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) 1− 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ,𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 )2 − 𝑐 𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ,𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 )∗ 𝑐 𝑜𝑟𝑟 ( 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ,𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) 1− 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ,𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 )2 ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭ (5) From (5) , we note that the omitted variable bias is negligible if data revisions and IMF modeling error are uncorrelated with each other and either is uncorrelated with the real-time variable. Under this uncorrelated assumption, the last two terms on the right of (5) (in curly brackets) vanish and take the omitted variable bias with them. Otherwise, the spillover estimate is expected to be biased. For now, we keep an open mind that the linear and uncorrelated as- sumptions hold as a reasonable approximation. Accordingly, we use for the estimations the following regression model obtained from (4) by moving the unobserved term(s) in the residual: 𝑌 𝑡 +1 − 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 = 𝛽1 + 𝛼2 (𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 )+ 𝛽3 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 + 𝜀 𝑡 +1 , (6) where 𝛽are parameters and 𝜀 𝑡 +1 = 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + ∈𝑡 +1 . Un- der the linear and uncorrelated assumptions, regression analysis of (6) is expected to yield an unbiased estimate of 𝛼2 . As an aside, we note that the two assumptions do not guarantee that the real-time variable and the unobserved IMF modeling error are or- thogonal. The estimate ̂ 𝛽3 may therefore be subject to omitted variable bias ( ̂ 𝛽3 ↛𝛼3 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 ). The conditions under which 𝛽3 is unbiased are discussed by Blanchard and Leigh (2013) . 2.2. Finite sample properties It is now clear that the spillover parameter can be estimated from a forecast error model under suitable conditions. How do these conditions compare with competing approaches, in particular the incumbent ap- proach of Suárez SerratoSuarez and Wingender (2016) and Chodorow- 2 R. Herrala and F. Orlandi Asia and the Global Economy 1 (2021) 100006 Reich et al. (2019) in finite samples? 2 For simplicity, we refer to (6) from here on as the novel approach, whereas under the incumbent approach the dependent variable is 𝑌 𝑡 +1 rather than its forecast error. We recall from previous discussion that both approaches are ex- pected to yield unbiased estimates if data revisions are white noise. Fur- thermore, if data revisions are not white noise but IMF modeling error is white noise, then only the novel approach should yield unbiased es- timates. Previous empirical work, however, provides some evidence that data revisions are not always white noise Aruoba, 2008 ), and that IMF fore- casts can show some biases ( IEO, 2014 ). To compare the omitted vari- able bias of ̂ 𝛼2 under the two approaches when neither data revisions nor modeling error are white noise, we reformulate ( (6) : 𝑌 𝑡 +1 = 𝛽1 + 𝛼2 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 )+ 𝛽3 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 + 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 + 𝜀 𝑡 +1 . (7) The restatement (7) of model (6) is similar in form to the incum- bent approach, except that they omit 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 and 𝛽3 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 from the right-hand side. We abstract for now from the omission of the latter term which, as it turns out, only has a minor influence on the spillover estimate at the global level. Under this restriction, our comparison of the incumbent and novel approach boils down to the impact on ̂ 𝛼2 of omission of 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 from the right-hand side of (7) . Based on Clarke (2005) , the omitted variable bias under the novel approach is expected to be smaller in absolute terms than in the incum- bent approach if: √ √ √ √ √ √ √ 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) ) 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝛼3 ( 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 ) ∗ 𝑎𝑏𝑠 ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 , 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) ) 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 , 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 ) ⎫ ⎪ ⎬ ⎪ ⎭ < 1 , (8) where abs gives the absolute value. For further benefit, we refer to (8) as the condition that the forecaster is well informed . Based on (8) , being well informed is a combination of two (multiplicative) criteria. The first variance criteria on the left ( 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) ) 𝑣𝑎𝑟 ( 𝛼3 ( 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 )+ 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 ) ) indicates that the smaller the vari- ance of IMF modeling error is relative to the variance of the sum of mod- eling error and forecasts, the better informed the forecaster and the more favorable the situation is for the novel approach. We note that the vari- ance criteria are favorable to the novel approach except where the IMF modeling error and real time forecasts are strongly negatively covariant. Negative co-variation could arise if the IMF tended to systematically over/under estimate contributing factors that influence GDP growth positively/negatively ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ≠𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 ) , or to over/underestimate the influence of positive/negative factors ( 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 ≠𝛼3 ) . The other criteria for being well informed relate to correlation of modeling error with data revisions ( 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 , 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 ) ) 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 , 𝛼3 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 − 𝛼𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 3 𝛼3 𝑂 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟 𝑡 |𝑡 )+ 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 ) ). Based on these criteria, the smaller the correlation between data revisions and IMF modeling error relative to the correlation between data revisions and the sum of modeling error and forecasts, the better informed the forecaster and the more favorable the situation for the novel approach. According to our interpretation, the correlation criteria indicate about how successfully the IMF manages to take into account in its forecasts of the spillover target countries the factors that drive data revisions in China. If data revisions and IMF modeling error are driven by dif- 2 See Eq. (6) of Suárez SerratoSuarez and Wingender (2016) and Chodorow- Reich et al. (2019) . ferent/similar factors, then this plays in favor of the novel/incumbent approach. To summarize, if data revisions in China are not fully independent of other causal factors of GDP growth in spillover target countries, then only the novel approach can still produce unbiased estimates of spillover. The estimate is unbiased if GDP data revisions in China and IMF modeling error regarding GDP growth in spillover target countries do not correlate. Otherwise, both the novel approach and the incum- bent approach are expected to yield biased estimates of the spillover parameter. The bias under the novel approach is smaller than under the incumbent approach if the IMF is well informed in the sense that its modeling error is small or only weakly correlated with its own forecasts of spillover target countries, or data revisions in China. These qualities seem appropriate for an institution like the IMF with a long history and prominent role as global forecaster. 3. Empirical analysis 3.1. The data The estimation data is from the IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) database, which provides access to forecasts and real-time data on an- nual real GDP growth of 177 countries. The real-time data and forecasts are published twice a year around April and October. The estimation sample starts at 2004, which is the first year for which the necessary data are available for a large number of countries. The sample ends in 2015, allowing at minimum three years for the statistical authorities to provide a reasonable final estimate of real GDP growth by 2018, which we use as the final data year. The final data year is selected based on the dynamics of squared data revisions in the WEO. For the relevant es- timation years, the median squared data revision is no longer increasing after three years from the first real-time data release. When studying the data, one quickly confronts the fact that it is never absolutely final. Data revisions can and do take place over many years, even decades, after the first real-time estimates appear. This issue may not significantly influence our findings, however, since independent ran- dom noise in the final data does not bias the spillover estimates. We nevertheless investigate the robustness of the estimation results to al- ternative definitions of final. For the benchmark model, the final data and the real time data are taken from the April vintages. We use the term observation year to in- dicate the year when the WEO was published. Since the April WEO is prepared at the start of the year, we use as the dependent variable ( 𝑌 𝑡 +1 − 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑌 𝑡 +1 ), the IMF forecast error of real GDP growth during the observation year. For example, the forecast error for the observa- tion year 2014 is computed by diluting from the real GDP growth rates given in the April 2018 WEO regarding year 2014 the forecast of real GDP growth given for the year 2014 in the April 2014 WEO. The data revision variable ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) indicates the year that precedes the observation year. For example, the data revision for ob- servation year 2014 is computed by diluting from the real GDP growth rate of year 2013 given in the April 2018 WEO the real-time estimate of real GDP growth in 2013 given in the April 2014 WEO. Real-time GDP growth ( 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) is measured correspondingly. For example, the real- time GDP growth rate for the observation year 2014 is the real GDP growth rate of year 2013 given in the April 2014 WEO. The IMF forecast errors and data revisions are, on average, positive at 0.17 pp and 0.5 pp, respectively ( Table 1 ). The overall biases are not large in relative terms. The median forecast error is less than 5% of the median forecast, and Chinese GDP data revision is about 5% of the average Chinese (real-time) GDP growth rate. Identification of the spillover parameter is not sensitive to a positive or negative overall bias in forecasts or data revisions, which are captured by the constant term of the econometric model. Average forecast errors ( Fig. 1 ) show positive autocorrelation. This feature may be benign from the point of view of the identifying as- 3 R. Herrala and F.

To investigate this, we suitably manipulate the latter variable. Data revisions show a downwards trend, especially during the final part of the sample ( Fig. 2 ). We explore the implications of this issue by, among other things, de-trending techniques. We note that the offi- Table 3 Regional variation of the spillover param- eter. ̂ 𝛼2 USD advanced economies − 15% 68.2 emerging Asia 27% − 41.9 emerging EU − 82% 27.3 Latin America 24% − 12.4 MENA − 60% 21.1 Sub-Saharan Africa − 18% 2.9 World, total − 8% 63.5 Notes: The areas follow the WEO classifi- cation.

This plays in favor of the novel ap- proach by introducing idiosyncratic variation in the exogenous variable. Note, for example the large positive data revisions during the observa- tion years 2007 and 2008. Since observation years lead the real-time years by one year, the two large data revisions refer to real GDP growth in China in 2006 and 2007. At the time, real economic activity grew fast even by Chinese standards. The bulk of the data revisions regarding these years were executed in 2009–2011 based, in part, on the 2008 census data and a revision of that data in 2010, as well as the revision in 2009 of the Statistics Law ( Holz, 2014 ). 3.2. Estimation results Model (6) is estimable by standard linear regression at country level without any further assumptions. To aggregate the 170 + spillover es- timates to the global level, we use median rather than the mean, since the latter is sensitive to outlier spillover estimates that reflect influential observations. We also show an estimate of the overall (across countries) spillover based on a (un-balanced) panel with country fixed effects. The fixed effects spillover estimator, which is significant at 10% ( Table 3 , Model 1) is at − 0.27, indicating negative spillover overall. Country level models ( Table 2 , Model 2) furthermore indicate that spillover from China was negative for most countries over the period 2004–2015 with a median spillover estimate at − 0.11. Based on the R2 statistics, the country level models typically explain 14% of the varia- tion in GDP growth rates within countries. The sum of p-values of the spillover parameter across the country models indicate that 92 coun- tries, or just above one half of the countries in the data, did not experi- ence significant spillover from China. A detailed study of the country-level findings ( Fig. 3 ; Table A1 in An- nex) is beyond the scope of the present paper. We note, however, that there is significant variation in spillover both regionally ( Table 3 ) and across countries (Annexed Table A1 ).

Spillover to advanced economies, which dominates the computations in USD, is negative. The overall regional and cross-country pattern is not easily compat- ible with the view that spillover mainly reflects the bilateral trade re- lationships between the spillover source and target country. The cor- relation of ̂ 𝛼2 with exports to GDP in the spillover target countries is at − 0.03 and with exports from China to GDP of the spillover target country at − 0.11. The weak correlations lead to the sus- picion that spillover from China, at least at the horizons studied here, may mainly operate via other channels than through the trade channel. What could this main spillover channel be? For further benefit we note the visual clue that the bulk of large hydrocarbon producers, in- cluding Saudi Arabia, the US, Russia, Iran, Norway, the UAE, Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and Mongolia, show negative or neg- ligible spillover. At a first glance, this result may seem counterintu- itive. Surely commodity producers benefit from increased production and the corresponding increased demand for natural resources from China? However, the demand for commodities presumably occurs prior to or simultaneously with the production process in China, where raw ma- terials and energy serve as inputs. This dynamic is not captured in the present analysis, which focuses on what happens in the target countries afterwards. The negative spillover observed in commodity-producing countries may therefore be the second-round effect following a positive demand shock from China in these countries. 3.3. Robustness tests Estimations with de-trended and demeaned data revisions ( Table 4 , Models 3 and 4) reinforce the finding of mostly negative spillover. We note that the estimations with detrended data show even stronger neg- ative spillover for the median country than the benchmark model. We also exploit the variation in real-time data to construct an alter- native shock variable. The approach builds on a decomposition of the overall data revision used in the benchmark model ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) into two components, i.e. the late revision that occurred after the Octo- ber vintage of the observation year ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 𝑂𝑐𝑡 ) , and the early revision that occurred between the April and October vintages of the observation year ( 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 𝑂𝑐𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 𝐴𝑝𝑟 ): 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ≡ 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 𝑂𝑐𝑡 + 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 𝑂𝑐𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 𝐴𝑝𝑟 (9) The two components of the data revision may have different statisti- cal properties, reflecting the process by which GDP data is compiled in China ( Holz, 2014 ). The early estimate of real GDP growth included in the April WEO is based on incomplete data. By the October WEO, the underlying data may be more complete. The Chinese statistical author- ities have also had more time to use the various means at their disposal to estimate the systematic components from the still missing data. Con- f idence that the late revision is cleaned from the influence of systematic components is stronger than for the early release. We therefore use the late data revision as an alternative shock variable ( Table 4 , Models 5 and 6; Fig. 4 ). The finding of mostly negative spillover 5 R. Herrala and F.

The fourth column is the sum of p values of the spillover parameter across countries. The global aggregates model 7 is from a regression of IMF forecast errors of world GDP on data revisions in China. In these models, the forecast error is averaged over the two years, starting with the observation year. As the independent variable, we use the average data revision of Chinese real GDP growth during the two years preceding the obser- vation year. The incumbent model 8 is like model 1 except that the endogenous variable is real GDP growth in spillover target countries and the exogenous variables are the demeaned and de-trended data revision, and the real time variable.

We, again, note somewhat larger (in absolute terms) negative spillover estimates for the median country than in the benchmark models. 3 We estimate the country level models using the IMF forecast errors of real GDP growth of the world as the left-hand side variable ( Table 4 , Model 7). The estimations confirm the robustness of the main finding of negative spillover to possible aggregation error and the lengthening of the forecast window. The negative correlation between IMF forecasts errors of global real GDP growth and data revisions in China is clearly visible in the data ( Fig. 5 ). We also study the incumbent model ( Table 4 , Model 8). Since this model is sensitive to correlation between data revisions and the other causal factors of GDP growth except spillover, we report results from the variant that uses as the shock variable the de-trended and demeaned data revision. Correlation of the country level spillover estimates from the incumbent model with the baseline model ( Table 2 , Model 2) is substantial at around 43%. 3 Revisions of data that was not available to the IMF at the time of the forecast was made would not be consistent with Eq. (3) and is therefore not attempted here. Fig. 5.

We furthermore use various alternative approaches (subsample esti- mations, a dummy variables approach, visual inspection of the data) to assess the sensitivity of the results to the global financial crisis, which started in 2009, and also other potential influential observations. Based on standard leverage measures, years 2008 and 2009 are, in particular, influential to the regression results for the global outcome. The result of negative spillover is robust to omitting these two years from the anal- ysis. The finding of negative spillover also emerges if we use October vintages instead of April vintages of the WEO data. (not shown) 3.4. The spillover channels The WEO database provides possibilities to shed further light on the spillover process. To this end, we apply the decomposition of real GDP growth into nominal values and prices 𝑌 𝑡 +1 ≡𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ∗ 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 , where GDP denotes the nominal GDP denominated in national currency, and pGDP its price index in spillover target countries. The spillover parame- ter can therefore be decomposed into a value channel and a price channel : 6 R. Herrala and F.

The WEO database includes real time data and forecasts of nominal GDP and GDP prices. The decomposition (10) can therefore be usefully studied based on the novel empirical approach. To arrive at an estimable equation, we first express the expected values of the two channels in terms of the expected values and covariances of their parts: ( 𝑎 ) ̂ 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙 = 𝐸 [ 𝜕 (𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ] = 𝐸 [ 𝜕 (𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] 𝐸 [ 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ] + 𝑐𝑜𝑣 [ 𝜕 (𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 , 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ] ( 𝑏 ) ̂ 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐 𝑒 𝑐 ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑙 = 𝐸 ⎡ ⎢ ⎢ ⎣ 𝜕 ( 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ) 𝜕𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ⎤ ⎥ ⎥ ⎦ (11) We then use the same econometric technique as before to estimate the partial derivatives ( 𝐸 [ 𝜕( 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] and 𝐸 [ 𝜕( 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ) 𝜕𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] ) . The estimated equations are: ( 𝑎 ) 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 − 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 = 𝛽1 ,𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 + 𝛼2 ,𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + 𝛽3 ,𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 + 𝜀 𝑡 +1 ,𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 ( 𝑏 ) 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 − 𝐹 𝐼 𝑀 𝐹 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 = 𝛽1 ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 + 𝛼2 ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 (𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 − 𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 ) + 𝛽3 ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 |𝑡 + 𝜀 𝑡 +1 ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 , (12) where 𝛼, 𝛽are estimated parameters and 𝜀 are residuals. Standard linear regression yields estimates on how Chinese economic growth impacts changes in nominal GDP growth rates ( 𝐸 [ 𝜕( 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] = ̂ 𝛼2 ,𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 ) and GDP price inflation ( 𝐸 [ 𝜕( 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ) 𝜕𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] = ̂ 𝛼2 ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 ) in spillover target countries. In this manner, we obtain estimates the price ef- fect [ 𝜕( 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ) 𝜕𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] 𝐸 [ 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ]= ̂ 𝛼2 ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝐸 [ 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ] and value effect 𝐸 [ 𝜕( 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 ) 𝜕𝐶 ℎ𝑖𝑛 𝑎 𝑡 ] 𝐸 [ 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ] = ̂ 𝛼2 ,𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝐸[ 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 𝑝𝐺𝐷 𝑃 𝑡 +1 ] . The covariance terms in (11) remain unknown. Their combined effect is computed as residual from (10) . Implementing this empirical strategy yields the main result that, on the global scale, the price effect is negative accounting for a large pro- portion of total spillover ( Table 5 ). In the benchmark model, the price effect is dominant in the sense that it is larger in absolute terms than the sum of the value effect and the combined effect. In the alternative model, where we use the late data revision as the shock variable, the price effect is larger in absolute terms than the value effect, but not as large as the combined effect. Based on the two models, we conclude that an acceleration in real GDP growth in China spills over to other countries by increasing their Fig. 6.

The increase in the price deflator ex- erts downward pressure on the real GDP growth rates in these countries. The estimations furthermore indicate a negative value effect, reflecting a change in economic activity in the spillover target countries in the aftermath of a GDP shock from China. To shed further light on the price channel, we study forecasts and real time data of commodity prices. The data exhibit a clear pattern ( Fig. 6 ) in which upward data revisions of Chinese real GDP growth are followed by a positive forecast error of global commodity prices. The correlation between the two series is close to 60%. Based on regression analysis with the novel approach (not shown), an increase in Chinese real GDP growth by one percent causes an increase in world commodity prices by over 4% one year ahead. 4. Discussion and concluding remarks The robust result of negative spillover from China strengthens the previous findings about the negative effects of Chinese economic de- velopment on various industries and sectors in other countries. Based on our study, negative spillover is not limited to market segments such as labor markets, certain sectors, or even countries. Instead, negative spillover seems to be the norm, and not the exception, globally one to two years ahead. So is negative spillover a China-specific phenomenon or is it appli- cable to other countries as well? We predict that, at least at the time horizon used here, spillover from most countries tends to be negative. This view is based on the findings about the spillover channels. Future studies will hopefully explore this issue further. Our finding that the price channel is a significant globally, and per- haps even the main spillover channel, is unexpected as earlier discussion tended to emphasize trade and employment effects. This finding places the issue of Chinese spillover in the domain of central banking. The on- going slowdown in China adds to the challenges of central banks (e.g. Bank of Japan, euro area central banks) facing abnormally low inflation. More generally, the findings emphasize the need to account for spillover in monetary policy analysis. All major central banks closely monitor in- ternational developments. The methodologies presented in this paper hopefully prove useful to quantify their impact on the domestic econ- omy. The novel empirical approach seems well suited to study spillover from other countries, as well as other types of spillovers and causal ef- fects. To this end, it harnesses the long experience and special position of the IMF in the global economy. Our analysis motivates the release of real-time datasets by professional forecasters such as the IMF in order to promote understanding of the world economy.
