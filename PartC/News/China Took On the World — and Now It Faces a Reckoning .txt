China Took On the World — and Now It Faces a Reckoning
Consider these numbers: China is home to 1.4 billion people, about 18% of the planet’s total population; 22.3 million people live in Shanghai and 11.7 million in Beijing alone. It has the world’s second-largest economy and has been on track to eventually overtake the US. Its geographic footprint is vast, covering more than 3.6 million square miles.

China is home to a thriving technology sector that has birthed well-known giants such as Tencent and Alibaba, and China’s corporate powerhouses collectively spent about $228 billion on research and development in 2022. Over the past 40 years, China has lifted 800 million people out of poverty — an epic achievement that some analysts consider the biggest reduction in inequality in the modern era.

China has also built a formidable military capacity featuring a world-class navy and air force, nuclear missiles, and cyberwarfare proficiencies. It regards the US as a robust economic and military competitor beset by social chaos and individualism so extreme that it undermines civil society. The South China Sea and Taiwan are flashpoints. Even as China’s economic growth seems to have plateaued, President Xi Jinping’s cult of personality and raw authoritarianism have recast the country’s image abroad and its direction at home.
