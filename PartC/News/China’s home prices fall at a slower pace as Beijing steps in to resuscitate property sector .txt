China’s home prices fall at a slower pace as Beijing steps in to resuscitate property sector
“The weakness from the property sector has persisted. In order for Beijing to reach its GDP growth target for this year, more easing is needed and likely to be implemented in a coordinated way,” HSBC said in a research note earlier this month.

The bank called for “a stronger push to stabilise the property sector, essentially using a holistic method to push forward the dual track model and reverse the current track of a continuous deterioration in the new home market segment.”

China has set an ambitious target to grow its economy by around 5 per cent this year, a challenging goal to meet as other factors complicate the country’s situation in addition to the trepidations of the property market.
