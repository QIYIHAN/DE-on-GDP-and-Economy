A relatively obscure economics professor at Renmin University in Beijing sparked a minor furore last month when he claimed a secret government research group had estimated China’s growth in gross domestic product could be as low as 1.67 per cent in 2018 — far below the officially published rate of 6.7 per cent for the year up to September. 

Most experts dismissed the speech by Xiang Songzuo as implausible, despite longstanding doubts about the reliability of China’s official GDP data. Yet although discussion of his claims was quickly scrubbed from the Chinese internet, the presentation has been viewed more than 1.2m times on YouTube — an indication of the raw nerve Mr Xiang touched with his doom-laden warnings. 

A decade ago, China played a vital role in rescuing the world economy from the financial crisis by launching an unprecedented Rmb4tn stimulus programme. Today, the fear in markets is the opposite. Already unnerved about rising rates in the US and slowing growth in Europe, many investors now worry that China could lead the global economy into the next recession. 

A warning from Apple on Wednesday about slowing iPhone sales in China has heightened concerns following a drumbeat of grim economic data, including outright declines in auto sales, home sales and factory profits. 

GDP growth slowed to 6.5 per cent in the third quarter last year, the weakest 3-month figure since the crisis-era low point in early 2009, and UBS said yesterday that fourth-quarter growth probably slowed further to 6.2 per cent. Nationalist tabloid Global Times reported widespread lay-offs in the technology sector in December.

	“Domestic sentiment is definitely very bad, perhaps even worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis,” says Fred Hu, founding partner of Primavera Capital, a Hong Kong-based private equity group, and former Greater China chairman for Goldman Sachs. 

“In theory, China has wide latitude to boost domestic demand to offset the trade war hit on external demand. But with sagging business and consumer confidence, private spending on both capital expenditure and personal consumption is more likely to trend down.” 

The signs of decelerating growth are by no means confined to China. Five advanced economies including Germany and Japan recorded contractions in the third quarter. In the US, almost half of US chief financial officers surveyed by Duke University believe the economy will be in recession by the end of 2019, and 82 per cent expect a recession by the end of 2020. In addition, the pent-up effects of nine quarter-point interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve may drag on the US economy. 

But even more than these concerns, the question that is hanging over global markets is just how vulnerable is China to a much sharper slowdown?

	Ominously, the recent downturn has occurred even though the expected hit to Chinese exports from the trade war has not yet materialised. In fact, analysts say exports probably received a one-off boost in recent months as traders front-loaded shipments to beat the expected tariff rise from 10 per cent to 25 per cent that US president Donald Trump threatened would take effect in January. That rise is now on hold due to the 90-day truce that Mr Trump agreed with Chinese president Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in Argentina last month.

The last time China caused such angst in global markets was almost exactly three years ago. In the opening days of 2016, a botched “circuit breaker” mechanism — intended to prevent uncontrolled drops in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets — instead sparked panic selling that led the blue-chip index to shed 7 per cent in a single day. That capped a tumultuous six-month period during which Beijing’s heavy-handed intervention failed to prevent a stock market bubble from bursting and a poorly executed currency devaluation sparked rampant capital flight. 

In the three years since, China seemed to prove its doubters wrong. The country tightened capital controls to stabilise the currency, while infrastructure stimulus and a housing rally powered a brisk recovery. The economy shined in Mr Xi’s crucial political transition year of 2017, helping him to consolidate power by eliminating term limits.

	Starting in mid-2016, policy shifted from stimulus to austerity, a response to years of warnings about financial risks from a rapid debt build-up. A “regulatory windstorm” targeting shadow bank lending, which had channelled loans to the riskiest borrowers, led to a sharp drop on off-balance sheet credit. 

Tighter credit combined with stricter environmental enforcement and a drive to shutter low-end factories — part of Mr Xi’s broader call for a “new era” in which growth quality would take priority over quantitative targets. 

“To some extent the slowdown is a result of the government’s own priorities. China is transitioning from relatively low cost to high cost, so a lot of old industries need to be shut down,” says Huang Yiping, vice dean at Peking University’s National School of Development, who stepped down from the People’s Bank of China’s monetary policy committee in June. “The key economic policy battles like cleaning up the environment and containing financial risk all contributed to the slowdown in economic activity,” he says.

	But the crackdowns on shadow banking and pollution brought unintended consequences. Both campaigns disproportionately hit smaller, privately owned businesses, which contribute around 60 per cent of GDP growth and 90 per cent of new jobs. Meanwhile, less efficient state-owned enterprises continue to enjoy preferential access to traditional bank loans. 

A wave of de facto nationalisations hit the private sector last year as cash-starved companies were forced to sell to better-financed state groups. A drive to increase collection of social insurance contributions from employers — a requirement local governments have long declined to enforce on smaller groups — added to cost pressure. 

Despite the slowdown, most economists are not forecasting a recession in China or even a slowdown to sub 5 per cent growth over the next two years.

	And while some analysts viewed the Apple sales fall as another sign of slowing consumption, others saw shifting consumer preferences at play. 

“The slowdown has not affected some of Apple’s rivals — particularly its local Chinese ones — suggesting that the US company is also lagging in terms of its product appeal,” says Ana Nicholls, head of industry research at the Economist Intelligence Unit in London. 

Mr Huang acknowledges that the official growth rate may be overstated. But he says that the so-called “Li Keqiang Index” — a gauge of tamper-resistant indicators such as electricity production and freight volumes, which premier Li Keqiang privately told a US ambassador in 2007 that he views as more trustworthy than GDP — still point to growth of “6 per cent or slightly below”.

	Still, global investors are wondering whether the government will now support the economy with a more forceful stimulus. A cabinet meeting in late July marked a decisive break with austerity, as policymakers called for new stimulus measures and cited “uncertainties in the external environment” — an oblique reference to rising trade tensions. 

Since then, China has implemented a series of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures, including pumping liquidity into the banking system and jump-starting big infrastructure projects like subways. But the scale of these efforts has been more modest than previous rounds in 2008-09 and 2014-15. 

“I don’t think they’re going to go for major stimulus. Policymakers know they’ve reached the boundaries of stimulus as being very helpful. So we’re stuck with the mild stimulus that we’ve seen,” says Yukon Huang at the Carnegie Endowment and former World Bank country director for China. 

The government’s light-touch approach to stimulus partly reflects the reduced policy flexibility today compared with 2008, when debt levels were lower and a simpler growth model based on investment in housing and infrastructure had more room to run. 

The amount of new capital investment required to generate a given unit of GDP growth has more than doubled since 2007, according to Moody’s Analytics. In other words, investment stimulus produces little bang for Beijing’s buck, even as it adds to the debt levels.

	But restrained stimulus has left markets underwhelmed. The blue-chip CSI 300 index fell 25 per cent in 2018, including 15 per cent since the July cabinet meeting. 

As a result, the government appears to be stepping up support for growth. At the annual central economic work conference in late December, which sets the policy agenda for the coming year, leaders pledged further tax cuts and signalled monetary loosening. Global stocks rebounded yesterday after the PBoC cut banks’ required reserves by $117bn in a fresh cash injection intended to boost lending. 

“They [Beijing] will soon have no choice but to launch massive stimulus,” says Alicia García Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. “They do not want to give away their credibility because they said they wouldn’t do it, but there is no time to be cautious any more. Not having growth is ultimately the worst outcome of all.”
