Xi Jinping tells US delegation China’s economy is ‘sound and sustainable’
Chinese leader also promises more policy support to build ‘world-class business environment’ in meeting with executives and academics
He rejects narratives that the economy is ‘collapsing’ or ‘reaching its peak’ and says Beijing will provide ‘broader room’ for foreign businesses
China’s economy is “sound and sustainable”, President Xi Jinping told an American delegation in Beijing on Wednesday, as he promised more policy support to improve the business environment.
More than a dozen prominent business leaders and academics were at the meeting – one of the biggest US delegations Xi has hosted in years. It comes as Beijing is ramping up efforts to rebuild business confidence in China at a time of economic uncertainty and rising tensions with the US.
A phone call between Ma Zhaoxu, China’s foreign vice-minister, and US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell coincided with Wednesday’s meeting. They discussed “international and regional issues” during the call, a Chinese foreign ministry statement said without elaborating.
